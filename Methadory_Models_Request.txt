SVM models and execution files for Methadory

Hi @f-ferraro,

My name is Mario Cazalla and I am a PhD student in La Paz Hospital (Madrid, Spain). I am a bioinformatician working hard in episignature discovery in rare diseases. I’ve been exploring Methadory and I find it to be a very useful tool for using in my work.
I am very interested in testing the tool and seeing its potential. However, I noticed that certain SVM models required to run the tool are not currently available in the repository. I am reaching out to kindly ask if you could provide these models (or a link to download them). 

Thank you in advance for your time and help. I look forward to hearing from you!
Best regards,

Mario Cazalla
